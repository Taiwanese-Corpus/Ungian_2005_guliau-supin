Dear A-hui：
How are you? Everything going fine?I do receive your journal"BONG-po"regularly since a while.I like it  a lot.Actually,I didn't order it but I'd like to do it.Shall I use the   credit card ordering form?
I only received one TBTS last autumn.Was this subscription confused with my TBTS- subscription? 
Please change my name to:Maja BUCHLER.
If you don't do it,I risk not receiving it!!!The postman doesn't know my christian name,only my family name which is BUCHLER.
Happy new year!
Maja
