Subject: Greetings from Holland 	Sinological Institute, Leiden University, P.O.Box 9515/2300 RA Leiden/Holland
Dear Dr. TiuN,
Although it has been quite a long time since I have left Taiwan, I want to thank again for your kind hospitality when I visited you and the ¡§Ko-hiong5 Tai5-gi2 Lo5-ma2-ji7 Gian2-sip8-hoe7¡¨ in June. It was very impressive for me to see with how much dedication you and the other members of the seminar pursue the study of Taioanji.
Meanwhile, I have returned to Holland and started to review the material I have collected in Taiwan. Maybe I will come back to Taiwan next summer. There is one thing I would like to ask you: next year in March I will present a paper at a conference on Taiwanese culture to be held in Bochum, Germany. Would you mind if I reprint a short passage of the magazine "Taioanji" in my article? This would surely be a chance that more people hear about your seminar and its activities. I would of course not reprint it without your permission. Hope to hear from you. Please convey my greetings to the other members of the Sunday afternoon meeting,         yours sincerely, 				Henning Kloeter
